  # some site need headers to make the request get thru, so need to find the headers, usually press F12 and click Network to find(user-agent/cookie/content-type etc)
  # proxies is easy to understand, some site will ban your request so you need proxies for it(especially when scraping site)
  # proxies format is easy to understand but need to provide http and https and then write in this format 'http://ip:port' or you can use proxymanager module to manage it

  soup = BeautifulSoup(response1.text, 'html.parser') #bs4 format

  for i in info_package:
    print(i.get_text()) # will print the top 10 movie's name
    
# you can use re module to get url/image/name/rating etc on douban site as a good way to learn re/bs4/requests module
